Marco Antonio,Dominguez Rueda,EPAM Systems,Senior Software Engineer,"Marco is a superb leader who is excellent at pulling teams together. He was strongly knowledgeable for his position, constantly reading and keeping track of the cutting edge technology in front end. Not only this, but he shared this knowledge with his peers everytime he could, and functioned as a great teacher to many people (myself included), constantly motivating us to push for the extra mile.

I highly recommend Marco Antonio Dominguez Rueda for any kind of web development job where strong leadership and teamwork skills are required.","5/5/16, 8:08 AM",
Jose Carlos Ixcoatl,Gomez Briones,Unosquare,Senior Frontend Developer,"Jose Carlos was an excellent mentor and team lead which I would absolutely love to have again as my team leader. He prioritized growth as a team over pursuing his own goals, and taught by example. His leadership helped deliver our project in time for the deadline, despite the high amount of changes made in the last second. ","4/19/16, 12:33 PM",
